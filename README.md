# NetMount
-----------

**NetMount** enables DOS systems to access shared directories from remote machines as if they were local drives. It operates over the UDP protocol. The DOS client supports any interface for which a DOS Packet Driver class 1 (Ethernet II) exists, including Ethernet network adapters, serial, parallel, and other hardware interfaces. NetMount is optimized for low-resource environments, making it suitable for retro computing, embedded platforms, and legacy system integration.

It consist of two components:

- **`netmount`**: A lightweight TSR (Terminate and Stay Resident) driver for DOS that allows access to remote directories as standard network drives.
- **`netmount-server`**: A cross-platform server application for POSIX-compliant operating systems (Linux, *BSD, macOS, etc.) and Microsoft Windows, designed to share directories with DOS clients over a network or serial port using built-in SLIP protocol support.

In addition to these core components, the NetMount project includes the supporting utility **`ninstall`**, a configuration-based installer (loader) for the DOS `netmount` client. [More info about the `ninstall`](UTILS.md)

## Japanese edition (日本語環境対応版)

Japanese filenames are converted to Shift JIS on the server side, enabling display and read/write operations for Japanese filenames on PC-9801/PC-9821 and DOS/V.
PC-9801/PC-9821 timer-compatible client version has also been created.
Please note that building from this source will only generate the Shift JIS server version and the PC-9801/PC-9821 client version.

日本語のファイル名をサーバー側でShift JISに変換するので、PC-9801/PC-9821やDOS/Vで日本語ファイル名の表示や読み書きが可能となります。
クライアントのPC-9801/PC-9821タイマー対応版も作成しています。
ここのソースでビルドするとサーバーはShift JIS対応版、クライアントはPC-9801/PC9821対応版のみ生成されますのでご注意ください。

## `netmount` (DOS Client)

- A TSR driver for DOS that allows mounting shared directories from one or more remote machines as local drives.
- It should work with MS-DOS 5.0 and newer and with sufficiently compatible systems such as FreeDOS.
- Has minimal dependencies - only a DOS Packet Driver class 1 (Ethernet II) is required.
- Implements Ethernet Type II frame, ARP, IPv4, UDP and its own NetMount protocol.
- Supports any network interface for which a DOS Packet Driver class 1 (Ethernet II) is available. This includes Ethernet adapters, as well as serial, parallel, and other interfaces supported through appropriate drivers.
- Does not require a system reboot when mounting additional or unmounting drives.
- Written in C99 and assembler for the Open Watcom v2 compiler.

## `netmount-server` (Directory Sharing Server)

- A cross-platform user-space application that shares directories over the network.
- Any directory can be shared, including the root (/) directory.
- The physical location of the directory is irrelevant (hard disk, RAM-based, CD-ROM, network-mounted drive, ...)
- Uses the UDP protocol.
- Includes built-in implementations of the IP, UDP, and SLIP protocols.
- Implements file name conversion to the DOS 8.3 format, including Unicode-to-ASCII transliteration.
- Supports POSIX-compliant operating systems (Linux, *BSD, macOS, etc.) and Microsoft Windows.
- Can run as a non-root/unprivileged user.
- Supports running multiple instances concurrently, each using a unique IP/port combination or
  a dedicated serial device.
- CPU architecture independent. Although it is currently developed on x86-64, the application is designed
  to be portable and should work on other architectures. It supports both little-endian and big-endian systems.
- Written in C++20. Compilation tested with GCC and Clang.

## Motivation
This project started from a need to access shared directories from remote machines on old laboratory device running DOS. This device lacked a network card and only had an RS232 serial port and a parallel port. I needed a solution that:

- Works over IP (including SLIP via serial port),
- Has minimal memory and CPU requirements.
- Is portable.

After researching available tools, I found nothing that fully met these needs. So I decided to build my own.

In the past, I have developed software for a number of industrial embedded devices, such as protocol converters, drivers for specialized hardware, and real-time signal processing systems. Therefore, creating new software is not a problem for me. However, the problem often lies in the availability of documentation. When developing NetMount, I could not find an official standard (API documentation) for the MS-DOS driver interface. As a result, I relied on unofficial documentation and existing source code that I found on the Internet.

I would like to mention https://mirror.cs.msu.ru/oldlinux.org/Linux.old/docs/interrupts/int-html/,
RBIL (Ralf Brown’s Interrupt List) and the source code of etherdfs-server and etherdfs-client. However, my thanks go to the authors of all the useful resources that I found on the Internet. Thank you.
