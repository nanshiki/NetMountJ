# `NInstall` (DOS Client)

The "ninstall" utility installs the DOS TSR NetMount driver using
parameters specified in a configuration file. Specifically, it launches
"NETMOUNT INSTALL" in the current working directory and passes
the supported parameters from the file as command-line arguments.
The user may also provide additional arguments.

The configuration file must contains lines in the format `"<key> <value>"`.
Supported keys are: `"IPADDR"`, `"NETMASK"`, `"GATEWAY"`, `"PACKETINT"`, and `"MTU"`.
The file must include the `"IPADDR"` key; all other keys are optional.
All other lines are ignored.

This format was chosen to be compatible with the configuration file used
by the mTCP project. For example, a file generated by the mTCP DHCP
client can be used directly.

**Executes:**
```
NETMOUNT INSTALL /IP:<local_ipv4_addr> [/MASK:<net_mask>]
                 [/GW:<gateway_addr>] [/PKT_INT:<pkt_int>] [/MTU:<size>]
                 [<additional_arg1> ... <additional_argN>]
```

**Usage:**
```
NINSTALL <config_file> [<extra_arg1> [<extra_arg2>] ... [<extra_argN>]]
  (up to 10 additional arguments)
```

**Arguments:**
```
<config_file>      Path to a configuration file in mTCP format
<local_ipv4_addr>  IPADDR value from the <config_file>
<net_mask>         NETMASK value from the <config_file>
<gateway_addr>     GATEWAY value from the <config_file>
<pkt_int>          PACKETINT value from the <config_file>
<size>             MTU value from the <config_file>
<extra_argX>       Additional argument passed to the NETMOUNT INSTALL command
```
